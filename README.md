APHASIA is defined as a language disorder resulting from damage to the brain (Davis, 2007). 
However, in addition to the language disability, aphasia produces significant psychosocial 
consequences for the person with aphasia and family members .In Albania we have a small 
number of therapist and large number of patients 300-400 / year . Patients and their 
relatives suffer from a considerable amount of professional, social, familial, and psychological 
stress . Through counseling as a scope of practice, Speech Language Pathologist tend to 
avoid emotional issues in therapy . This project intend to create an online counseling software 
to deal with the large number of patients . This software will generate a database of verbal 
and audio expression from patients , familiars and SPL . This database will be used as a trace 
for a self counseling software . The database will be improved with audios and texts  in Albanian 
with the help of the SPL students in collaboration with the Faculty of Technical Medical Science .
