## Synopsis
Engineer a whole new flow that persists user data across conversations to allow
the user to manage a movie watchlist.

## Plot
Add support for each user to manage a watchlist of movies that interest them. On
the Movie details page, add the ability to save the current Movie to the
watchlist. Add support for the user to retrieve the watchlist with all
previously saved movies at any time.

*Tip: There are several ways to relaunch the conversation. For example,
continuation training with conversation drivers or a card with an on-click
intent*

*Pro tip: You can persist user data as [Activity
Cards](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/dev-guide/developers/modeling.modeling-actions.transactional-workflows#giving-updates-with-activity-cards),
or using [a remote
server](https://github.com/bixbydevelopers/capsule-samples-collection/tree/master/user-data-persistence)*

## Rating
5 stars for being able to save all the Toy Story movies to a watchlist and
retrieve it at a later time.
