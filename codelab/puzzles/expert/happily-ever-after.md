## Synopsis
Test a Capsule using Bixby Stories.

## Plot
1. Use the [Device
Simulator](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/dev-guide/developers/ide.simulator)
to find a movie (giving no inputs for person, genre, or release date).

  > *Tip: Setup instructions and example utterances are listed in the [Capsule
README file](../../../README.md)*

2. Pick a genre and pick a movie, then [export your conversation into a
Story](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/dev-guide/developers/testing.stories_assertions#exporting-a-story-from-the-simulator)

  > *Tip: You may need to disable "Selection Learning" before you may export a story, if so you'll find
that control within the User Learning settings in the left sidebar of the Device Simulator.*

3. Spruce up this Story with more branches, where in each branch you choose a different genre and movie.

  > *Tip: When you click on any step in the Story Editor, an "Add steps" button will appear below
that step, so you may insert new steps from that point by returning to the Device Simulator.*

4. Next, [write a new
Story](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/dev-guide/developers/testing.stories_assertions#writing-stories)
for finding movies by release window and/or person (cast or crew member).

  > *Note: The use of Story Mode while creating brand new stories is not yet described in the documentation,
feel free to experiment.*

5. [Write a simple
assertion](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/dev-guide/developers/testing.stories_assertions#developing-assertions)
to test the Dialog for this Story.

6. Explore adding more stories and assertions if you’d like. Then open the [Story
Dashboard](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/dev-guide/developers/testing.stories_assertions#running-multiple-stories-story-dashboard)
and run all your stories.

## Rating
5 stars for a green Stories Dashboard.
