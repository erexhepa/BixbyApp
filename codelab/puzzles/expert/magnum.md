1. In the absence of defined layouts, the platform is generating a default
[`result-view`](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/reference/type/result-view)
that shows raw unpolished tables with the data. Create a new `result-view` to
match your movie credits Model.

2. Display the cast and crew along with images
using [Bixby
Views](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/dev-guide/developers/building-views).

## Rating
5 stars for Bixby Views that display the Zoolander movie credits in their best
light.
